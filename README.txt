QuickRafter calculates wooden truss parameters.

Years ago I was working as roofer assistant and the common problem was poor quality of wooden truss. It was consequence of not propriete cutting the elements, especialy: hip rafters.

The main aim was to calculate common rafter and hip rafter parameters.
Introduced later: purlin, purlin prop.
Calculations are verfied in Inventor - 3D modeling application from Autodesk.
Other truss elements are in development phase - do not use it.

Final version of this program will be developed by using Qt framework because my goal is to make this program to be friendly for Non-Programmers and very easy ti use.

I have been writing this program before i started using GIT so not all changes are available.
